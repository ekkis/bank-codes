# Bank Codes

A package that allows the caller to extrace SWIFT codes published by the http://bank.codes service

## Install
Add to your project from the NPM repository:
```
npm install bank-codes --save
```
and grab an instance:
```javascript
// using ES6  modules
import bc from 'bank-codes';

// using CommonJS modules
const bc = require('bank-codes');
```

## Usage

The methods in this package store the data retrieved into a `cache.json` file.  This package contains such a file and most clients will simply want to use it directly, rather than scanning the site for the data.  The file may be included like this:
```js
const bc = require('bank-codes/cache.json')
```

The following methods are available in the package:

### countries()

Returns an object keyed by country names and values a path within the site see a list of banks
```javascript
{
    "United States": "/swift-code/united-states/"
}
```
### banks(country)

Retrieves the list of banks for the given country.  The return value is similar that below:
```javascript
[
    {
        "Name": "1ST PMF BANCORP",
        "City": "LOS ANGELES",
        "Branch": "",
        "SWIFT": "PMFAUS66HKG"
    }
]
```

## Examples

The methods return promises so their return values need to be waited for
```javascript
// as a promise
bc.banks('United States').then(console.log);

// async/await
(async () => {
    console.log(await bc.banks('United States'));
})()
```
## Notes

The cache file produced when calling package methods may become stale across time but can be regenerated by running:
```bash
npm run cache
```

Additionally, bank lists for specific countries can be generated and added to the cache file via parameters to the command (titlecased) e.g.
```js
npm run cache Mexico Sweden 
```
will output progress information to _stderr_ and the output to _stdout_ so it can be captured:
```js
npm run cache Mexico > Mexico.json
```
The script will also accept the _url_ of a page, which allows resuming a process in case a country fetch breaks in the middle.  The command below will process page 63 for the US list and all subsequent pages:
```js
npm run cache "https://bank.codes/swift-code/united-states/page/63/"
```
Also, to watch the script operate, set the following environment variable: `export DEBUG=Y`

## Contribute
